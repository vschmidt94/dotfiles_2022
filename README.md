# Yet Another Attempt to Organize My Dots

The 17th time is the charm...  I mainly ignore my dots until some hardware has
to be replaced and then wish I had done better previously.

Now using Dotbot to manage the dotfiles.  
- Dotbot is submodule in repo
- Maintain the links in install.conf.yaml
- Run ./install to build links
